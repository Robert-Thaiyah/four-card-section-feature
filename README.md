## My process

- First I created one card and made sure it was perfect then duplicated the card and copied the other content on them.
- Decided to go with a grid structure as using margin-left and margin-right to align the items was a waste of time and headache-inducing.
- Using the grid-template-columns made it easy to move around the cards till they looked the same as the design provided.
- Grid columns also helped them have equal spacing. If I was to use the margin-left and margin-right measurements, they would have looked bad.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- CSS grids help immensly to align items properly. I shall try to see of grid-areas can replicate the same final solution.

### Continued development

- CSS grids and Flex work well and will be practising on it fully.

### Useful resources
